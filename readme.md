Fallout encounter table viewer and parser
============

How to use:
1. Copy worldmap.txt from game "data" folder to repository root.
2. Run worldmapparser.py (you need Python 3 for that) - this will generate worldmap.json.
3. Host the folder in a local web server (if you have python installed on windows, you can just run "!host.cmd")
4. Open the page with your browser.
